SaGaseous
Saturn is a gas planet with no solid surface.  It is like having a planet with just clouds and no ground.
SaOneMoon
Saturn has at least one moon. In fact, Saturn has at least 30 moons!
SaManyMoons
Saturn certainly has many moons. In fact, Saturn has at least 30 moons!
SaDenseAtmosphere
Saturn, a gas planet, can be thought of as a planet that is all atmosphere.  The deeper into the planet, the thicker the atmosphere.
SaRings
Though they look solid from Earth, Saturn's rings are actually made of particles ranging from the size of a grain of sand to the size of a small house.
SaOrbitsInMoreThanYear
Saturn travels around the Sun slowly. Saturn takes almost 30 Earth years to make 1 complete orbit around the sun.
SaMagneticField
Saturn has quite a strong magnetic field. A compass could definitely be used there.
SaWinds
Saturn is a windy place. The winds of Saturn travel at nearly 1,120 miles per hour (1800 kilometers per hour)!
SaReleaseEnergy
Saturn is slowly shrinking because it is giving off more energy than it is receiving from the Sun.
SaLargeMoon
One of Saturn's moons, Titan, is larger than the planet Mercury.  If Titan orbited the Sun instead of Saturn, it could be called a planet.
SaJupiterLike
Saturn is similar to Jupiter.  It is a gas planet with no solid surface, like Jupiter, and its size is closer to Jupiter's size (as compared to Earth).
SaAurora
Charged particles from the Sun interact with the magnetic field at Saturn's poles to produce beautiful light shows called "aurora."
SaShrinking
Saturn is slowly shrinking, but because of its size we are not able to see the changes.
SaMoonAtmosphere
One of Saturn's moons, Titan, has an atmopshere.  Titan's atmosphere is made of nitrogen and methane.
SaLargerEarth
Saturn is much larger than Earth. Saturn is nearly 75,000 miles wide while Earth is just 8,000 miles wide.
SaVisited
Saturn has been visited by several Earth satellites.  These missions studied Saturn's atmosphere, moons, rings, magnetic and electric fields, and more.
SaRotatesTenHours
Saturn rotates on its axis very quickly. 1 day on Saturn (one complete turn on its axis) is just over 10 Earth-hours long.
SaMostMoons
Saturn has more moons than any of the other planets. As of early in the year 2001, Saturn has 30 known moons.
