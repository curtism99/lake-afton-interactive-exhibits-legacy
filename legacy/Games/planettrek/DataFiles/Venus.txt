VeCarbonDioxide
The atmosphere on Venus is made mostly of carbon dioxide.  Carbon Dioxide is what we humans breathe out as waste.
VeHot
The thick, carbon dioxide atmosphere of Venus doesn't let much heat escape from the planet.  Temperatures on Venus are over 800 degrees!
VeSmall
Venus is just a bit smaller than Earth.  Venus is about 7,500 miles across and the Earth is close to 8,000 miles across.
VeAcidClouds
The clouds in Venus' sky are made of sulfuric acid.  Sulfuric acid is a dangerous chemical that can burn skin.

VeOrbitsInLessThanYear
Venus travles around the Sun quickly. Venus makes 1 complete trip around the Sun in just 225 Earth days.
VeEarthLike
Venus is similar to Earth.  It is a solid, rocky planet, like the Earth, and its size is closer to the Earth's size (as compared to Jupiter).
VeNoMoon
Venus has no moons.
VeRotatesSlowest
The Earth takes 24 hours - one day - to rotate once on its axis.  Venus takes 243 Earth days to rotate once!
VeVisited
Venus has been visited by many spacecraft.  Most of the missions to Venus were Russian missions.
VeLanded
Several spacecraft have landed on the surface of Venus to learn about the planet.  
VeRotatesOpposite
Nearly all the planets rotate the same way they orbit the Sun: counter-clockwise.  Venus, however, rotates clockwise on its axis.
VeLessMoons
Venus has less than five moons. In fact, Venus has no moons at all.
