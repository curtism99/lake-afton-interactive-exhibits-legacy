MaCraters
Many, many craters cover the surface of Mars.  Craters are formed when large meteorites crash into the surface.
MaCarbonDioxide
Most of the very thin Martian atmosphere is carbon dioxide, a gas that humans breathe out as waste.
MaSmall
Mars is smaller than Earth.  Mars is about 4,200 miles across and Earth is close to 8,000 miles across.
MaRocky
Mars is a solid planet made of rock material.
MaOneMoon
Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.  These moons are probably former asteroids, captured by Mars' gravity long ago.
MaVolcanoes
Mars has several volcanoes, including the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.  Its base is nearly as large as Kansas.
MaOrbitsInMoreThanYear
Mars travels around the Sun slowly. Mars makes 1 complete trip around the Sun in 687 Earth days (almost two Earth years).
MaPolarCaps
Because temperatures are so cold near the north and south poles, carbon dioxide is always frozen into massive, polar ice caps.
MaEarthLike
Mars is similar to Earth.  It is a solid, rocky planet, like Earth, and its size is closer to the Earth's size (as compared to Jupiter).
MaSeasons
Because Mars is tilted, different areas receive more sunlight at different parts of the year, producing noticeable seasons.
MaVisited
Mars has been visited by many spacecraft.  These spacecraft have studied Martian weather, geology, and more.
MaLanded
Several spacecraft have landed on the surface of Mars to learn about the planet.
MaLessMoons
Mars has less than five moons. In fact, Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.
