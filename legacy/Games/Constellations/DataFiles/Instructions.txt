This is the Constellation Game. 
The goal is to identify 5 constellations while taking a minimum amount of hints.

You get 30 points per constellation if you don't take any hint.
If you ask for a hint you lose 5 points.
However, you lose 10 points if you choose the wrong constellation.You will get a maximum of 2 hints per constellation.

If you still can't identify the constallation you get zero points.

You can play the game with or without review.
In case you choose to play with review, you will see 10 constellation and the constellations that you will have to identify in the game will be 5 of the 10 constellations you reviewed.

The scoring method is the same in both cases.
