Derth Fader has programmed your ship's computer to blow itself up. 

Your only hope of survival is to locate Vader's base and defuse the bomb before it goes off.

Your ship's sensors can locate the general direction of Vader's base, but only the scanners can locate the base accurately. You must decide what objects to scan.


WARNING !!
If you scan the wrong place, Vader may detect you and move his base. 
Too many wrong scans and you will run out of time.
