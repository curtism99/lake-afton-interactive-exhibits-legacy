JuGaseous
Jupiter is a gas planet with no solid surface.  It is like having a planet with just clouds and no ground.
JuOneMoon
Jupiter has at least one moon. In fact, Jupiter has at least 60 moons as of Jul '04!
JuManyMoons
Jupiter certainly has many moons. In fact, Jupiter has at least 60 moons as of Jul '04!
JuDenseAtmosphere
Jupiter, a gas planet, can be thought of as a planet that is all atmosphere.  The deeper into the planet, the thicker the atmosphere.
JuRings
Jupiter has very thin, faint rings.  Unlike Saturn's famous rings, Jupiter's rings cannot be seen from Earth, even with a telescope.
JuLargest
Jupiter, over 88,000 miles wide, is the largest planet in the solar system.  More than one-thousand Earths could fit inside Jupiter.
JuOrbitsInMoreThanYear
Jupiter travels around the Sun slowly. Jupiter takes almost twelve Earth years to make one complete trip around the sun.
JuMagneticField
Jupiter has quite a strong magnetic field. A compass could definitely be used there.
JuLightning
Because of Jupiter's strong electric fields, electric charge can build up in Jupiter's atmosphere layers.  These charges are released as lightning.
JuReleaseEnergy
Jupiter is slowly shrinking because it is giving off more energy than it is receiving from the Sun.
JuLargeMoon
One of Jupiter's moons, Ganymede, is larger than the planet Mercury.  If Ganymede orbited the Sun instead of Jupiter, it could be called a planet.
JuJupiterLike
Jupiter is the standard used when comparing the other gas planets of our solar system such as Saturn and Uranus.
JuAurora
Charged particles from the Sun interact with the magnetic field at Jupiter's poles to produce beautiful light shows called "Aurora."
JuShrinking
Jupiter is slowly shrinking, but because of its size we are not able to see the changes.
JuLargerEarth
Jupiter is much larger than Earth. Jupiter is over 88,000 miles wide while Earth is just 8,000 miles wide.  Over 1,000 Earths could fit inside Jupiter.
JuVisited
Jupiter has been visited by several Earth satellites.  These missions studied Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetic fields, radiation, moons, and more.
JuLanded
Jupiter has no ground to land on, but in 1995 a probe was dropped into the atmosphere.  It sank through the clouds sending back information.
JuRotatesTenHours
Jupiter rotates on its axis very quickly. 1 day on Jupiter (one complete turn on its axis) is only 10 Earth-hours long.
