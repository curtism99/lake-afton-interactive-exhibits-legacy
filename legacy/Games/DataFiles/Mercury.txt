MeCraters
Here are some of the many craters on Mercury's surface.  These craters formed when meteorites crashed onto Mercury.
MeCold
Mercury doesn't really have an atmosphere to keep it warm, so nighttime temperatures can be as cold as 300 degrees below zero.
MeHot
Mercury is so close to the Sun that day time temperatures can reach as high as 870 degrees.
MeSmall
Mercury is a small planet. It's about 3000 miles across, less than half the size of Earth.  (Earth is about 8,000 miles across.)
MeRocky
Mercury is a solid planet made of rock material.
MeOrbitsInLessThanYear
Mercury travels around the Sun quickly. Mercury makes 1 complete trip around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
MeMagneticField
Mercury has a strong enough magnetic field that a compass could be used there.
MeEarthLike
Mercury is similar to the Earth.  It is a solid, rocky planet, like Earth, and its size is closer to the Earth's size (as compared to Jupiter).
MeNoAtmosphere
Mercury has no atmosphere.  In other words, there is no significant layer of gas surrounding Mercury, like air surrounds Earth.
MeNoMoon
Mercury has no moons.
MeVisited
In 1974, this spacecraft, Mariner 10, became the first spacecraft to visit Mercury.  It flew by the planet and sent back many pictures of Mercury's surface.
MeLessMoons
Mercury has less than five moons. In fact, Mercury has no moons at all.
