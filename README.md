# Lake Afton Public Observatory Interactive Exhibits
Web-based interactive slideshows and infographics for tablets and computers at the Lake Afton Public Observatory

## Slideshows
The old LAPO computers contained some old slideshows. Seth will add them here under /legacy and we should create new HTML/Javascript based slideshows and infographics based on the old slideshows and including any updates to out-of-date information.

Feel free to submit new slideshows and infographics as well.

## Technology
We need to find a good HTML/Javascript based slideshow/presentation system for these. The setup will likely be one on-site local server and several small Raspberry Pi tablets connecting to these over Chromium.

For now let's plan on using http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/ for the presentations.
